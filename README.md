## Deliverables

### MVP

- create a form using React.js that allows users to submit information
- the form should have the following features:
  - fields for name, email address, and phone number
  - validation to ensure that all required fields are filled in
  - validation to ensure that the email address is valid
  - a submit button that sends the form data to a server (you can use a mock server or API, or use a tool like Mockoon or Postman to mock the server)
  - a success message that is displayed upon successful submission
  - clear the form fields upon successful submission
- use Create React App to set up the project
- use functional components and hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect)
- use CSS modules or styled components for styling
- use a form validation library like Formik or React Hook Form to handle form validation
- use Git for version control and commit frequently with clear commit messages
- write clear and concise code, and comment where necessary
- host the application on a public Git repository and provide the link to the repository

### Stretch Goals

- add more fields to the form, such as address or date of birth
- use a serverless architecture with a service like Firebase or AWS Lambda to handle form submissions
- implement real-time validation as the user fills out the form, such as showing an error message when the user types of an invalid email address
- add client-side error messages for each field that is invalid
